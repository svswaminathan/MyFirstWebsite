    Many new parents are unsure about how to give their baby a bath. Unsolicited advice from people around you can be nerve wracking. Follow these tips for making bath time easier for you and your baby. Bathing your baby offers a great opportunity for wonderful interaction between you and your child.</p>
 

<b>SAFETY TIPS TO REMEMBER AT ALL TIMES</b>
<ul>
<li>Babies can drown in less than an inch of water and in less than 60 seconds. Never leave your infant alone or walk away from your baby even for a moment</li>

<li>Make sure the temperature of the water is comfortable (slightly above room temperature)</li>

<li>Donâ€™t put your baby in the tub while the water is still running. The temperature could change rapidly and make conditions unsafe.</li>

<li>Use only baby soaps and baby shampoos. Avoid bath oils and bubble baths.</li>

<li>Your baby does not need a bath in the tub until the umbilical cord has fallen off. A sponge bath in the first few days is good enough. If your baby has been circumcised, wait until the wound has healed</li>

<li>A portable bathtub is ideal for your baby until he has grown out of it.</li>

<li>Always hold your baby gently but firmly, avoiding sudden movements.</li>

<li>Make sure that you have everything that you may need before you start.</li>
